				<img src=img/books/notes-from-underground.jpg></img>
				<span><b>Notes from the Underground</b>
					by Fyodor Dostoevsky

					Philisophical/Dark Fiction
					136 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Dostoevsky’s most revolutionary novel, Notes from Underground marks the dividing line between nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In complete retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man’s essentially irrational nature.</td>

					76 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>But all this contributes to increase the measures of suffering in human life out of all proportion to its pleasures; and the pains of life are made much worse for man by the fact that death is something very real to him. The brute flies from death instinctively without really knowing what it is, and therefore without ever contemplating it in the way natural to a man, who has this prospect always before his eyes. So that even if only a few brutes die a natural death, and most of them live only just long enough to transmit their species, and then, if not earlier, become the prey of some other animal</td>

				<span><b>The Brothers Karamazov</b>
					by Fyodor Dostoevsky

					Classic, Fiction
					796 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>The Brothers Karamazov is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of erotic rivalry in a series of triangular love affairs involving the “wicked and sentimental” Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov and his three sons―the impulsive and sensual Dmitri; the coldly rational Ivan; and the healthy, red-cheeked young novice Alyosha. Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.</td>
			<td style="display: none">I saved reading the Brothers Karamazov until my early twenties, believing that some of the concepts would pass over my head otherwise. I was probably right. At the time when I started reading Dostoevsky, I had a particular distain for religion. The years of forced Sunday service had slowly withered me down, and besides, I was about to enter university. What need did I have for religion? What role could it possibly have in my beliefs?

			In its essence, the Brothers Karamazov is a debate. What is worth pursuing: spirituality, truth and reason, or earthly pleasures? Each of these positions is embodied by one of the Karamazovs, and their arguement is posited through their actions. Like in many of his other books, Dostoevsky masterfully creates these fictional characters, and each carries their own set of beliefs and afflictions. In the end, the reader can decide which life is better and whether Dostoevsky's own conclusions are justified.

			Of course so much has already been said about this novel. My own experiences towards it are probably typical of many others (though I tried to limit my exposure to what others had to say while reading it). In the end, this novel allowed me to think about and question certain aspects of faith, a task that is necessary if one is ever able to obtain a certain degree of spirtual knowledge. </td>

					by Aldous Huxley

					Dystopian Fiction
					288 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Largely set in a futuristic World State of genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social 				hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, 				psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning that are combined to make a utopian society that goes 				challenged only by a single outsider.</td>

					by Hermann Hesse

					Philisophical Fiction

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Narcissus and Goldmund tells the story of two medieval men whose characters are diametrically opposite: Narcissus, 				an ascetic monk firm in his religious commitment, and Goldmund, a romantic youth hungry for knowledge and worldly 				experience. First published in 1930, the novel remains a moving and pointed exploration of the conflict between the 				life of the spirit and the life of the flesh. It is a theme that transcends all time. </td>

			</td>
			<td>The Trial is the terrifying tale of Josef K., a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested 				and must defend himself against a charge about which he can get no information. Whether read as an existential tale, a 				parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism, The Trial has 				resonated with chilling truth for generations of readers.</td>

					by Oscar Wilde

					Philisophical/Dark
					Fiction
					367 pages
				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Written in his distinctively dazzling manner, Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty is the author's most popular work. The tale of Dorian Gray's moral disintegration caused a scandal when it first appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel's corrupting influence, he responded that there is, in fact, "a terrible moral in Dorian Gray." Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment.</td>

			<td>'The Wall' introduces three political prisoners on the night prior to their execution. Through the gaze of an 				impartial doctor--seemingly there for the men's solace--their mental descent is charted in exquisite, often harrowing 				detail. And as the morning draws inexorably closer, the men cross the psychological wall between life and death, long 				before the first shot rings out.</td>

				<span><b>The Plague</b>
					by Albert Camus

					Philisophical/Absurdist
					Fiction
					308 pages
				</span>

			</td>
			<td>A gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind 				confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a 				parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the 				plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes a omnipresent reality, obliterating 			all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.</td>

					by H.G. Wells

					Horror
					153 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.</td>

But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer the chance of redemption.</td>

					by Selby Hubert

					Dark Fiction
					290 pages

				</span>

			</td>
			<td>Described by various reviewers as hellish and obscene, Last Exit to Brooklyn tells the stories of New Yorkers who at every turn confront the worst excesses in human nature. Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations.</td>

The book takes the form of Huxley's recollection of a mescaline trip 				that took place over the course of an afternoon in May 1953. </td>

	<div id=about-pane class=content-pane>This <i>was</i> a self-hosted site that I ran from my house using a bunch of raspberry Pi's. Things have changed, my new router doesn't have functional port-forwarding, and my raspberry Pi's were discovered on <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">Shodan</a>. Now I host it here, on Github pages! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions you can reach me at m.arg12@protonmail.com</div>
