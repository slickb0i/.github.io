  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>It's pretty convienient to maintain cheatsheets for the various CLI tools you use on a daily basis. While it's probably better in general to reference the man pages, some tools are pretty low risk and so you might not want all the fine details. A good example is the "tar" tool, which seems to need atleast 3-4 flags to successfully unarchive a tar file.</p>
  <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
  <p>A <a href="http://cheat.sh/">pretty neat project</a> already accomodates this needs. It uses the curl command to pull a cheatsheet hosted on the web. An example execution is shown here:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">~ : curl cheat.sh/tar
# tar
# Archiving utility.
# Often combined with a compression method, such as gzip or bzip.
# More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar>.

# Create an archive from files:
tar cf target.tar file1 file2 file3

# Create a gzipped archive:
tar czf target.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

# Create a gzipped archive from a directory using relative paths:
tar czf target.tar.gz -C path/to/directory .

  <p>There is also <a href="https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/create-view-interactive-cheatsheets-command-line/">this other tool</a> which I found in the process of writing this article. I haven't used it but it looks pretty good as well</p>

  <h2>Customized solution</h2>
  <p>I created some simple bash functions that would access my cheatsheets in a specified directory. Each of these cheatsheets would be a simple text file with minimal formatting similar to cheat.sh above.</p>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Create a directory where you want your cheatsheets to be stored. In my case, these files are in a git repository alongside config files and other scripts pertaining to my system. Using git simply allows for quicker setup on a new system.</p>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Add the functions which provide a simple command line interface. In my case I'm using zsh, so I'll be adding this to my <i>~/.zshrc</i> file, but it your case it may be <i>~/.bashrc</i> or whatever config corresponds to the shell you use. Notice that im using vim to edit my cheatsheets.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash"># User functions
function cheat {
        if [ "$1" = "-l" ]; then
                ls ~/linux-things/cheatsheets/
        elif [ "$1" = "-e" ]; then
                vim ~/linux-things/cheatsheets/$2
        else
                cat ~/linux-things/cheatsheets/$1
        fi
}</code></pre>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Reload (source) the changed file, or open a new terminal. Here's an example usage (-e edits or creates a cheatsheet if it doesn't exist):
  <pre><code class="language-bash">~ : cheat -l
apt   gdb          git  ida       irssi  mount   powershell  radare  tmux  wireshark
bash  gdb-indepth  gpg  iptables  linux  pacman  ps          tar     vim   zip

~ : cheat tar
--- tar files ---
tar xvzf [file].tar.gz 	    	# Decompress and extract archive
tar xvjf [file].tar.bzip2	    # Decompress and extract archive
tar -cf [archive].tar [files]	# Compress

~ : cheat -e find</code></pre>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>So far these cheatsheets have worked well for me, allowing for the customization that I want. In the future I might add some improvements in accessing the cheatsheets.</p>
